This plugin takes the IP address of a networked printer from the presentation properties, and prints to it by opening up a TCP socket on port 9100.

In order to print a PDF, add it to list under File->Presentation Properties->Files.
Then modify the default value of the user variable "printerIP" to match your printer's IP address.
